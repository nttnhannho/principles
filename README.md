# principles
We have multiple principles for programming such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), SOLID principles, Avoid Premature Optimization, Law of Demeter, Separation of Concerns, ect.
In this project, I am gonna show you the codes which simply explain how do the principles look like when we apply to our code.
